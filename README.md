# Monorepo Starter
This is a sample starter app with the things I like to have.

Monorepo setup for sharing TS types and functions.

React frontend with vite.

Backend is Express.

CLI tools.

## Fake Todo App
The base app is fake todo stuff. You should strip it all out when you wanna do your own thing.

## Things To Update
 - [ ] Update the `name` field in `package.json` to your project name
 - [ ] Do global search for "@monorepo" and replace with your project name
 - [ ] Add .env files where needed
